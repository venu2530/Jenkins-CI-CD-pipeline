# CI/CD Pipeline README

This document provides an overview of the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline implemented for the imaginary code repository.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. It is designed to ensure code quality, reliability, and consistency throughout the development lifecycle.

## Directory Structure

```

├── helm/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── charts/
│       └── your_application_chart/
│           ├── Chart.yaml
│           ├── templates/
│           │   ├── deployment.yaml
│           │   ├── service.yaml

└── pom.xml
```

- `src/helm/`: Contains the Helm chart for the application.
- `src/helm/Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the Docker image of the application.
- `src/helm/charts/`: Directory for Helm charts.
- `src/Jenkinsfile`: Jenkins pipeline script defining the CI/CD workflow.
- `src/pom.xml`: Maven POM file for the Java project (assuming it's a Java application).

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline**:
   - Triggers on every commit to the `develop` branch.
   - Builds the application.
   - Runs tests.
   - Generates necessary artifacts (e.g., Docker image, Helm chart).

2. **QA Approval Workflow**:
   - Automated deployment to a QA environment.
   - Automated testing in the QA environment.
   - Manual approval step by QA team for promoting to production.

3. **Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline**:
   - Triggers on approval from the QA team.
   - Deploys the application to the production environment.

```

## Usage

1. **Setting Up Jenkins**:
   - Configure Jenkins to interact with the Git repository, Kubernetes cluster, and any other tools required for the pipeline.

2. **Defining CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Customize the Jenkinsfile to suit your specific requirements and tooling.

3. **Running the Pipeline**:
   - Commit changes to the `develop` branch to trigger the CI pipeline.
   - After QA approval, the CD pipeline will deploy the application to the production environment.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure proper configuration of Jenkins, including installation of required plugins and setting up appropriate credentials.
- Regularly review and update the pipeline scripts to accommodate changes in the project requirements and tooling.
